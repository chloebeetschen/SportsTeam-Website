# SportsTeam-WebApp
A basic website for my university sports team using Html, CSS and JavaScript - all frontend, no backend


INFORMATION:

Colour Schemes:
The colours I have used on the website are a combination of:
- Different shades of grey
o This is to make different sections of the website stand out or be
separated from each other.
o The grey shades also give the website a minimalistic look and do
not take away/distract viewers from the images or texts. - Greens
o I have used #154432 (a dark shade of green) as the background for many of the buttons on the website.
▪ I have done this as this colour is the colour of our logo and this makes the website more consistent as well as more tailored to the football club.
o In addition, #d5e7e1 has been used to continue with the theme of the LUUWAFC colours but with a lighter and more matte tone to it, drawing less attention to the colours and more attention to the information.
- Black
o For the text colour, I have used black to make the text colour
stand out compared to the white background to enable more visibility and ease of reading for viewers.
Fonts:
For the font I have used 'Courier New', monospace, this is because it is a very neutral font where all the letters are visible and readable, it also however, stands out as it isn’t used generically on most websites, this giving the website a more unique look.
I have also kept the font consistent throughout the website to keep a sense of familiarity throughout the website.

For the layout of my website, I have kept the main navigation at the top with a smaller one in the footer, these are here to enable easy navigation through the webpages for the user.
Each page has been divided into sections, this is to make it easier to understand and view. I have split sections into columns where needed, this is to fill the page more rather than having everything spread out vertically.
My use of a grid style layout is to space out elements on the pages whilst still having sections grouped together. It also enables the page to be resized whilst continuing to keep its format.
I have tried to give each page a unique look, whilst keeping subtle consistencies across them all (such as colours and grid layouts).
